# Aanu Oshakuade — About me.

Minimal serif-driven personal page with a soft three.js point cloud background, inspired by clean editorial layouts.


## Customization notes
- Fonts: heading uses Cormorant Garamond; body uses Source Serif 4. Update in `<head>` if you prefer another pairing.
- Point cloud palette is teal/charcoal/mint; tweak in the `palette` array in `index.html`.
- Background haze and spacing live in the CSS `body` and `.wrap` rules.
